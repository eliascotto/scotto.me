Developer, reader, occasional writer. Opal's dad.

Software and prose are more connected than most people think — both use languages and symbols to communicate ideas, both rely on patterns for structure. What differs is the reader: humans or machines.

I'm currently building better software for human readers. I write about programming languages, software, and sometimes review uncommon books or movies.

Based in Australia. I've worked with startups across the US and Europe.
