I have a passion for programming computers, as well as reading books. In the [blog](/blog) section you can find some tech notes, some reviews, and essays on various topics. 

I'm not that active on social networks bcause I try to do more interesting things with my free time. You might find me on [Bsky](https://bsky.app/profile/scotto.me) sometimes. I release the code I write for hobby on [Github](https://github.com/eliascotto), and most of it with an open license, or without any license at all.
