I’ve recently had the chance to try Rust for a project and it has been a surprising pleasant experience. Rust is a modern language and I felt quire familiar with it in a few days. It has a simple and effective design and thanks to that, it gets frequently mentioned as a successor to old low level languages C like. Rust is *fast* and, in a lot of benchmarks, the compiled code performance is comparable to C and C++. I don’t have experience yet with other similar low-level languages as *[Nim](https://nim-lang.org/)* or *[Zig](https://ziglang.org/)* but I believe that there’s a reason why Rust got extremely [popular](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#section-admired-and-desired-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages) in the last few years.

In this article I’ll write down a quick overview of the most important concept that I found make Rust a different and more evolved language compared to it’s predecessor. The Rust [documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) is really well written with a lot of example and it will allow you to use the language in a very short time.

## Memory Safety
Rust is a memory *safe* language which means that it’s design prevent the programmer to do operation that could provoke memory faults and crashes of the program. If you ever wrote C or C++ you know what kind of bugs I’m talking about. This kind of problems are hard to spot and debug and in complex programs, it gets easy to use an already free memory or to forget to free one.

There have been two main ways to manage program memory. One is letting the memory management in the hands of the programmer (as C, C++), and the other is using a Garbage Collector that will clean the unused allocated memory portions for you (as Lisp, Java, Python, JS). Manually freeing the memory can get complicated with large and complex programs, and automatic garbage collection can slow down your execution at random, and it’s not that easy to control. 

Rust bring a different approach; writing programs that are actually memory safe by design. It does that by not exposing the memory management functions, without using an external tool to do the job. It introduces the concept of *ownership*, a set of rules that check your code at *compile time* to prevent you to do  operations that break the ownership of a variable.

### Ownership
This are the ownership rules:
1. Each value in Rust has an _owner_.
2. There can only be one owner at a time.
3. When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be *dropped*.

```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello"); // s1 is the owner of the String
let s2 = s1; // s2 becomes the new owner, and s1 is invalidated
println!("{}, world!", s1); // This will cause a compile-time error because s1 is no longer valid
```
The previous code will not compile. The compiler would even give you suggestion to what caused the error: `error[E0382]: borrow of moved value: s1`. One may think that the string s1 should still be there, but in reality Rust already called `drop` on the string structure, deallocating the memory segment and making it no longer valid.

Rust is getting in the way of the programmer for a good reasons; following this rules will prevent problems with memory deallocation, like forgetting to deallocate something, accessing a resource already deallocated, or double freeing a variable. In exchange, Rust is enforcing some patterns and providing some data structure to solve all ownership problems. The following is a useful schema I found on reddit, that quickly points you to which data structure is better to use for each scenario (`T` is the generic data type).

### Borrowing
Borrowing is a mechanism that allows you to create references to data owned by another variable, enabling multiple parts of your code to access and potentially modify the same data without transferring ownership.
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    change(&mut s);
}

fn change(some_string: &mut String) {
    some_string.push_str(", world");
}
```
In the code above, I've just created an *mutable reference* to a `String` object, and passed it to a function that modify the string. This behaviour it's called borrowing, since we *borrow* the value, and then give it back to the caller when finished using it.

In Rust, we cannot borrow as *mutable* variable more than once. This restriction of preventing multiple mutable references to the same data, helps preventing [*data races*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition#Data_race) at compile time.

## Structs and objects
Rust allows the creation of custom data types using `struct` and `enum`. A struct is between a C *struct* and a C++ *class*. It can be used as object and have access to `self`, but it’s missing a full support for *inheritance*.
```rust
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

impl Rectangle {
    fn new(w: u32, h: u32) -> Rectangle {
        Rectangle {
            width: w,
            height: h,
        }
    }

    fn area(&self) -> f64 {
        (self.width * self.height) as f64
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut rect = Rectangle::new(3, 4);
    println!("Area: {}", rect.area());
}
```
A new struct `Rectangle` has been defined, with a simple `area` method which access the property using the reference to itself.

When a new struct is defined inside a file, it can be *encapsulated* simply by avoiding the use of `pub` on the methods. This way, they will not be visible from outside but still accessible from inside.

### Traits
*Polymorphism* can be pefrormed by defining a `Trait` which adds the possibility to have shared behaviour between structures. 
```rust
trait Area {
    fn area(&self) -> f64;
}

impl Area for Circle {
    fn area(&self) -> f64 {
        std::f64::consts::PI * self.radius * self.radius
    }
}
```
Here I've defined a trait `Area` which every shape struct can implement in it’s own way. The trait it’s only the function signature, with parameters and expected return type.

### Enum
Enum are just a way of define a set of values that a variable of that type can take. It’s similar to `struct` in the sense that accept the use of `impl` with custom methods and traits.
```rust
enum Animal {
    Bird,
    Insect,
    Fish,
    Mammal,
}
```

## Pattern matching
Pattern matching is a construct that is essential in the Rust design. It allows to automatically match the value of a variable using it’s possible states, similar to the statement `case` in other languages. I use the operator `match` that receives the variable and give the possibility to execute code when a value is matching.
```rust
impl Animal {
    fn can_fly(&self) -> bool {
        match self {
            Animal::Bird => true,
            Animal::Insect => true,
            _ => false, // Covers Fish and Mammal
        }
    }
}
```
For example, here it's matching all the possible states that a variable of type `Animal` can have. The option `_` is a catch-all pattern, representing all the other possible states that the variable can take.

## Result and Option
Two enumerated types that are part of the Rust standard library are `Result` and `Option`. They’re values used to deal with errors that need to be managed and potentially absent values. To access the value, the pattern matching method shown above is required.

`Result` is used in case a function may fail and there's a need to grab the exception and handle it. Rust allows functions to throw errors and then catch them from the caller by performing a `match` on the function's returned value.
```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io;

fn read_file(path: &str) -> Result<String, io::Error> {
    let file = File::open(path)?;
    let mut contents = String::new();
    file.read_to_string(&mut contents)?;
    Ok(contents)
}

fn main() {
    match read_file("example.txt") {
        Ok(contents) => println!("File contents: {}", contents),
        Err(error) => println!("Error reading file: {}", error),
    }
}
```
`?` is a special operator in Rust that allows to return the error directly, saving you the boilerplate of writing another match.

`Option` instead is used to return an optional value, since Rust doesn’t have the concept of `null` (and no Null Pointer Exception).
```rust
fn find_first_even(numbers: &[i32]) -> Option<i32> {
    for num in numbers {
        if num % 2 == 0 {
            return Some(*num);
        }
    }
    None
}

fn main() {
    let numbers = vec![1, 3, 5, 7, 8];
    match find_first_even(&numbers) {
        Some(even) => println!("First even number: {}", even),
        None => println!("No even numbers found"),
    }
}
```

## Functional
Rust took *closures* and *iterators* from functional programming. It's easy to write inline functions and iterate over array with the set of functions available for functional programming.
```rust
let numbers = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let doubled: Vec<_> = numbers.iter().map(|x| { x * 2 }).collect();
```
In the code above I'm using `map` over a list of numbers, and running the lambda function `|x| x * 2` on it, in fact creating a closure. If you need to add the possibility to add iteraction support to a struct, you would need to implement the `Iterator` trait, as shown [in the docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/trait/iter.html)

## Analyzer
[rust-analyzer](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer) is what is going to help you understanding Rust and the patterns that the language is guiding you to use. When integrated inside your favourite editor (I’m using [Zed](https://zed.dev/) right now), you will see warning and errors generated directly when saving a file.

Let’s try to analyse some broken code
```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1;
    println!("{}", s1);
}
```
Why is this code broken?
```rust
error[E0382]: borrow of moved value: `s1`
  --> src/main.rs:4:20
   |
65 |     let s1 = String::from("hello");
   |         -- move occurs because `s1` has type `String`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
66 |     let s2 = s1;
   |              -- value moved here
67 |     println!("{}", s1);
   |                    ^^ value borrowed here after move
   |
   = note: this error originates in the macro `$crate::format_args_nl` which comes from the expansion of the macro `println` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
help: consider cloning the value if the performance cost is acceptable
   |
66 |     let s2 = s1.clone();
   |                ++++++++
```
Rust is telling that when the code does `s2 = s1`, it moves the value `s1` so it cannot be used anymore in the `println` call. A solution is to *clone* `s1` into `s2` so it will then have two independent instances of the string. Pretty handy to find a quick solution, especially for beginners. The Rust team did a great job for creating high quality error messages to guide the user to find a solution.

## Macros
Rust supports different types of macros: *declarative* and *procedural*. Macro helps extending the language by removing boilerplate code and even extending programs with external code (e.g. plugins).

Declarative macros are called like functions, they just append `!` to their name.
```rust
#[macro_export]
macro_rules! vec {
    ( $( $x:expr ),* ) => {
        {
            let mut temp_vec = Vec::new();
            $(
                temp_vec.push($x);
            )*
            temp_vec
        }
    };
}

let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4]; // Creates a new vec inline
```
My suggestion is to avoid using macros and always prefer functions where possible. Macros are hard to understand, maintain and document when they get complex.

## Cargo and packages
`cargo` is the official package manager for Rust. It downloads the dependencies and keep track of the Rust version the project is supporting. It can be used for all the task related to the project, like running, building it, generating the documentations, etc. The package registry is [crates.io](https://crates.io/) which counts more than 140K packages as today.

## Tests
Rust provides a test framework directly in the language which supports both *unit* and *integration* tests. `cargo test` is how to run all the tests for a project.

This is a unit test example, included in the same file of the function implementation.
```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    #[test]
    fn it_works() {
        let result = 2 + 2;
        assert_eq!(result, 4);
    }
}
```

## When to use Rust
Rust at the moment is getting really popular, but I believe it is not a solution for all types of problems. When performance are a requirement, instead of using C or C++, Rust can provide a significant improvement over them. Rust is nearly as *fast* as C, but it is definitely *safer*, and the choice will pay off..

Rust new UI frameworks are emerging every year, and I believe is in a great spot, despite not being object oriented, to become the go-to language for creating the next generation of desktop apps. Checkout [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) which is a faster replacement than Electron, or the new [GPUI](https://www.gpui.rs/) which uses native libraries and looks very promising.
