<p class="home-p">
   I have a life-long passion for computers and technology in general.
   My love for building things led me to work with
   startups around the world, where I could take an active role in creating new products.
</p>

<p class="home-p">
   My background has been primarily in developing <strong>web
   applications</strong> from the ground up. I've been working extensively with
   modern JS frameworks for years. Today I work as a
   full-stack engineer, focusing on Clojure backend development.
   In the past, I've worked in multiple startups from Silicon Valley, to Switzerland, to Australia.
