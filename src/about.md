<p class="home-p">
   I have a life-long passion for computers and technology in general.
   My love for building things led me to work with
   startups around the world, where I could take an active role in creating new products.
</p>

<p class="home-p">
   My background has been primarily in developing <strong>web
   applications</strong> from the ground up. I've been working extensively with
   modern JS frameworks for years, including React, Vue, and Node.js or Python backends.
   Today, I work as a full-stack engineer, mostly focusing on Clojure backend development, and I've become passionate about functional programming in general. I've worked in multiple startups from Silicon Valley 🇺🇸, to Italy 🍝, to Switzerland 🧀, to Australia 🦘, and have also developed websites and small mobile apps as side projects.
