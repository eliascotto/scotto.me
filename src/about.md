I have a passion for programming computers, as well as reading books. In the <a href="/blog">blog/</a> section you can find some tech notes, some books and movies reviews, and essays on various topics that interest me.

Some of the projects I've worked on are available on <a href="{{ meta.github }}">github</a>.
