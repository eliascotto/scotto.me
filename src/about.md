I'm a software engineer with a broad spectrum of interests that brought me to work in multiple startups around the world. At Sysdig (US), I started as intern when the team was small and my focus has been to develop web UIs for both the open source (sysdig-inspect) and the commercial product (sysdig-monitor). At CloudAcademy (Swiss) I worked on the UI of the learning platform and then shifted to the data science team to help develop a course reccomendation system. At AudienceRepublic (Aus) I was implementing features for the CRM, improving users workflows and the extraction of helpful statistics about events audience.

I have a passion for programming computers, as well as reading books. In the [blog](/blog) section you can find some tech notes, some books and movies reviews, and essays on various topics that interest me.
