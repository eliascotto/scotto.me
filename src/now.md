This is a [/now](https://nownownow.com) page, a snapshot of what's happening in my life right now. 
If you have your own site, [you should make one](https://nownownow.com/about), too.

Updated: *{{ today | defaultDate }}*

- Started reading Infinite Jest (exciting!) and keeping open tabs with references and reading guides.
- Finishing a review of Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov in italian and I'll try to translate it in english.
- Still writing another long article
- Trying to use RSS reader for first time to keep track of great blogs out there. I couldn't find a way to keep track of content. I still don't like RSS since it's concentrated only on new content, like a feed; I would rather prefer a way that gives old content almost same importance as new one, since there's always old content in a blog before I discover it.

### Currently reading

- Infinite Jest, David Foster Wallace
- Perdido Street Station, China Mi√©ville
- Swann's way, Marcel Proust
